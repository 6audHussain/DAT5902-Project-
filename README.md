## An Analysis of Trends and Patterns

---

## 1. Overview
This repository contains an analysis of crime victimisation trends in the UK, focusing on demographic and socio-economic disparities. Using datasets spanning multiple years, the analysis examines victimisation rates in relation to age, ethnicity, income, and geography. The goal is to uncover patterns that can inform policymakers and community initiatives aimed at reducing crime and its impact.

The primary research questions include:
1. What trends in crime victimisation are observable across age groups over time?
2. How do victimisation rates correlate with income levels and ethnicity?
3. How do crime victimisation rates align with population demographics in specific areas, such as London?

The analysis leverages datasets on crime victimisation, household income, and population demographics. Insights derived from this study can guide policy development and resource allocation to enhance public safety and address systemic inequalities.

## 3. Datasets
### Crime Victimisation Data
- Focus: Victimisation rates by age, ethnicity, and geography (2014â€“2020).
- Key variables: Age, Ethnicity, Geography, Victimisation Rate, Sample Size.
- Preprocessing: Removed irrelevant columns, filtered invalid data, and standardised geographic labels.

### Household Income Data
- Focus: Income distribution by ethnicity, particularly households earning above GBP 2,000.
- Key variables: Ethnicity, Income Brackets, and Time Periods.
- Preprocessing: Mapped ethnicities to align with victimisation data and filtered relevant income brackets.

### Population Demographics Data
- Focus: Population percentages by ethnicity in UK regions.
- Key variables: Ethnicity, Geography, and Population Percentages.
- Preprocessing: Mapped ethnicities, filtered for London-specific data, and retained relevant variables.
